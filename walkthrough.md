**IMPORTANT: Make sure to set the API key and model before running the extension.**

1. The first step is to decide the LLM provider you want to use, and then you will need to set up an account with them. Here are the providers currently support:
   - [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api)
   - [Google](https://developers.generativeai.google/)
2. Next, you need to get an API key from the LLM provider you selected.
   - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication)
   - [Google API Key](https://developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/setup)
3. Then you can browse the different models they offer and decide which one to use.
   - [OpenAI Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview)
   - [Google Models](https://developers.generativeai.google/models/language)
4. The last step is to set your API key and the model in settings, and the step on the right will take you to settings where you can set both of those options. Below is also a video walkthrough of how to set the API key and model.
